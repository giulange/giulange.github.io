Soil scientist and researcher in pedometrics and geospatial informatics.  
Works on digital soil mapping, environmental data systems, and the development of decision tools for sustainable land use.  
Builds custom electronics and PCBs for research and fun.

Giuliano Langella is Associate Professor in the field of Pedology (AGR/14) at the University of Naples Federico II. His research is focused on applying quantitative and digital methods to study soil-landscape interactions and to develop FAIR-aligned environmental information systems.

He actively contributes to European and national research projects addressing soil health, sustainable agriculture, and spatial decision support systems (S-DSS). He’s also obsessed with prototyping electronic systems based on Raspberry Pi, ESP32, and designing custom PCBs to support environmental monitoring networks.

When he’s not calibrating models or debugging sensor firmware, he enjoys woodworking and spending unreasonable time optimizing Linux installs that no one asked for.
