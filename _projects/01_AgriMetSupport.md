**General description**  
AgriMetSupport is an interoperable, modular Cyber-Physical System (CPS) designed to manage sensor networks, weather stations, and agrometeorological data across heterogeneous territories. The system supports advanced risk management and territorial planning through standardized and geospatially integrated workflows.

**Role**  
Creator, technical and scientific lead.

**Specific activities**  
- Design and implementation of the data architecture
- Integration and management of meteorological sensor networks
- Development of quality control, gap-filling, and spatial interpolation modules
- Real-time visualization and data access via an interactive dashboard
- Implementation of interoperability standards to ensure scalable, federated sensor integration
- Designed and implemented an interoperability layer to ensure seamless integration between agro-meteorological data sources
