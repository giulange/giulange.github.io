**Full title**  
SOILS4MED – Integrated Systems for Soil Health Monitoring and Management in the Mediterranean

**Programme**  
PRIMA – Partnership for Research and Innovation in the Mediterranean Area

**General description**  
The SOILS4MED project aims to develop harmonized and interoperable systems for monitoring **soil health** in Mediterranean agroecosystems, combining field observations, digital data integration, and decision-support models.  
The project addresses the European Soil Strategy for 2030 by promoting sustainable soil management practices and by designing open, standardized frameworks for soil data exchange and assessment.

**Role**  
Task co-leader.

**Specific activities**  
- Technical and scientific support for adapting the **LandSupport platform** to the Mediterranean partner countries involved in the project.  
- Contribution to **geospatial modeling**, integrating soil, climate, and land management data through interoperable workflows.  
- Contribution to the **definition and assessment of the soil health indicator**, ensuring methodological consistency and spatial applicability across regions.  
- Design of harmonized soil indicators and data integration schemes.  
- Support in technical data management and validation of soil-related datasets in the integration process within the LandSupport platform.
