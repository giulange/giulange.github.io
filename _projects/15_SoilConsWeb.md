**Full title**  
SOILCONS-WEB – Multifunctional Soil Conservation and Land Management through the Development of a Web-Based Spatial Decision Supporting System

**Programme**  
LIFE+ (LIFE08 ENV/IT/000408)

**General description**  
The SOILCONS-WEB project aimed to develop, test, and implement an innovative Spatial Decision Support System (S-DSS) focused on soil and landscape conservation.  
The DSS was designed to assist land managers and decision-makers in preserving soil quality, improving landscape management, and facilitating the implementation of complex EU environmental directives, regulations, and national planning frameworks.

The system integrates high-quality spatial data layers related to soils and landscapes and is entirely web-based (Web Spatial Decision Supporting System, WS-DSS).  
Through its online interface, the DSS provides users — including public authorities, private stakeholders, and research institutions — with access to analyses, reports, and thematic maps on agriculture, forestry, and environmental management.

Initially developed and tested over a 20,000-hectare pilot area in Southern Italy (Valle Telesina, Benevento, Campania region), the system was later extended to four additional European regions.  
SOILCONS-WEB promoted a participatory approach by combining traditional _top-down_ decision mechanisms with _bottom-up_ contributions from local stakeholders, thus enhancing transparency and collaboration in environmental governance.

**Sector**  
Desertification, land degradation, and drought.

**Main impact**  
Reduction of soil quality degradation through improved management and conservation practices.

**Action type**  
Soft (capacity building, knowledge transfer, stakeholder engagement).

**Keywords**  
Landscape management, Environmental governance, Soil conservation, Forest planning, Hydrogeological risk prevention, Agriculture, Biodiversity, Urban and regional planning, Geographic Information System, Climate change adaptation, Soil quality.

**Geographical scope**  
Regional (Campania, Italy)

**Start date**  
01/01/2010

**End date**  
31/01/2014

**Role**
Crucial contribution to the definition and development of the dynamic and geospatial component of the decision support system via web.
