  abstract     = {Under the same perspective of the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 15.3 aiming to restore degraded land and soil, one of the current priorities of the new Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) is to overcome the serious environmental problems raised by intensive agriculture. Despite the steps forward guaranteed by new technologies and innovations (e.g., IoT, precision agriculture), the availability of real operational tools, which could help the member states fulfil the high requirements and expectations of the new CAP and SDGs, is still lacking. To fill this gap, in the H2020 LandSupport project, the web-based best practice tool was developed to identify, on-the-fly, optimized agronomic solutions to help achieve land-degradation neutrality. The tool's core is the ARMOSA process-based model, which dynamically simulates the continuum soil–plant–atmosphere, combining several cropping systems, crops, nitrogen fertilization rates, tillage solutions, and crop residue management for specific regions of interest. It provides a synthetic “Best Practice index” to identify the optimized local solutions, which combines the production, nitrate leaching, and SOC_change, according to the end-user dynamic requests. The tool was implemented for three case studies: Marchfeld Region in Austria, Zala County in Hungary, and Campania Region in Italy, which are representative of a variety of different pedoclimatic conditions. In the present work, we report three possible cases of use in supporting best practices aiming toward soil and water conservation: (i) crop production optimization; (ii) impact of management practices (i.e., cover crops) over soil carbon; (iii) lowering the impact of nitrate leaching.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Nowadays, there is contrasting evidence between the ongoing continuing and widespread environmental degradation and the many means to implement environmental sustainability actions starting from good policies (e.g. EU New Green Deal, CAP), powerful technologies (e.g. new satellites, drones, IoT sensors), large databases and large stakeholder engagement (e.g. EIP-AGRI, living labs). Here, we argue that to tackle the above contrasting issues dealing with land degradation, it is very much required to develop and use friendly and freely available web-based operational tools to support both the implementation of environmental and agriculture policies and enable to take positive environmental sustainability actions by all stakeholders. Our solution is the S-DSS LANDSUPPORT platform, consisting of a free web-based smart Geospatial CyberInfrastructure containing 15 macro-tools (and more than 100 elementary tools), co-designed with different types of stakeholders and their different needs, dealing with sustainability in agriculture, forestry and spatial planning. LANDSUPPORT condenses many features into one system, the main ones of which were (i) Web-GIS facilities, connection with (ii) satellite data, (iii) Earth Critical Zone data and (iv) climate datasets including climate change and weather forecast data, (v) data cube technology enabling us to read/write when dealing with very large datasets (e.g. daily climatic data obtained in real time for any region in Europe), (vi) a large set of static and dynamic modelling engines (e.g. crop growth, water balance, rural integrity, etc.) allowing uncertainty analysis and what if modelling and (vii) HPC (both CPU and GPU) to run simulation modelling ‘on-the-fly’ in real time. Two case studies (a third case is reported in the Supplementary materials), with their results and stats, covering different regions and spatial extents and using three distinct operational tools all connected to lower land degradation processes (Crop growth, Machine Learning Forest Simulator and GeOC), are featured in this paper to highlight the platform's functioning. Landsupport is used by a large community of stakeholders and will remain operational, open and free long after the project ends. This position is rooted in the evidence showing that we need to leave these tools as open as possible and engage as much as possible with a large community of users to protect soils and land.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, Land Degradation Neutrality (LDN) is on the political agenda as one of the main objectives in order to respond to the increasing degradation processes affecting soils and territories. Nevertheless, proper implementation of environmental policies is very difficult due to a lack of the operational, reliable and easily usable tools necessary to support political decisions when identifying problems, defining the causes of degradation and helping to find possible solutions. It is within this framework that this paper attempts to demonstrate a new valuable web-based operational LDN tool as a component of an already running Spatial Decision Support System (S-DSS) developed on a Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI). The tool could be offered to EU administrative units (e.g., municipalities) so that they may better evaluate the state and the impact of land degradation in their territories. The S-DSS supports the acquisition, management and processing of both static and dynamic data, together with data visualization and on-the-fly computing, in order to perform modelling, all of which is potentially accessible via the Web. The land degradation data utilized to develop the LDN tool refer to the SDG 15.3.1 indicator and were obtained from a platform named Trends.Earth, designed to monitor land change by using earth observations, and post-processed to correct some of the major artefacts relating to urban areas. The tool is designed to support land planning and management by producing data, statistics, reports and maps for any EU area of interest. The tool will be demonstrated through a short selection of practical case studies, where data, tables and stats are provided to challenge land degradation at different spatial extents. Currently, there are WEBGIS systems to visualize land degradation maps but—to our knowledge—this is the first S-DSS tool enabling customized LDN reporting at any NUTS (nomenclature of territorial units for statistics) level for the entire EU territory.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Today, the issue of biodiversity conservation is, more than ever before, one of primary importance since it has become common knowledge that biodiversity provides many services that are relevant to the sustaining of ecological integrity and, so, for the benefit of humanity. Within this framework, rural areas are particularly exposed to degradation threats and, therefore, biodiversity loss due to their lying between and interlinking with urban and natural areas. The European Commission underlines the relevance of this conservation in its Biodiversity Strategy for 2030, which identifies a series of needs for conserving biodiversity in Europe, among which is the need for more operational tools to support biodiversity management. This paper aims to demonstrate that a geoSpatial decision support system (S-DSS), developed through focused interdisciplinary research and implemented over a Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure, might provide a powerful web-based operational tool to encourage both the engagement of a large range of end-users and stakeholders and the better implementation of the Habitats Directive as indicated by the Biodiversity Strategy for 2030. The platform supports data visualization and on-the-fly computer applications for modeling, all via a web browser. The S-DSS tool brings together knowledge of soil and environmental sciences, biodiversity and information technology. The S-DSS tool is demonstrated through three use cases in the Campania region (Southern Italy) from different users' perspectives. The connection of data and model aims to provide information that will improve knowledge and awareness of biodiversity. In just a few clicks, the production of maps, results and statistics provides an overview of the biodiversity over a personalized area drawn by the user. The approach is highly transferable to other areas, from other administrative regions to the whole European territory, because it is based on general algorithms that are easily applied elsewhere, providing there is the necessary data availability.},

The European Green Deal is one example of a concertation effort in a world where data availability, sharing options, and just-in-time exploitation are not entirely solved. The LandSupport service responds to this challenge through a combination of a Spatial Decision Support System on top of a datacube management and analytics engine. In this paper, we specifically focus on this datacube engine and how it can contribute to a better decision making through an ordered multidimensional data management paired with strictly standards-compliant interfaces. Further, the approach described shows a remedy against the current fragmentation of services: through a location-transparent federation a single common pool of information is established, including distributed fusion allowing an unlimited mix-and-match of data regardless of their location.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Soil forensics is not only a well-established research domain but has also been used in numerous successful international searches for burials and as trace evidence to help police and law enforcement in solving criminal, environmental and terrorism investigations. However, despite the confidentiality and legal constraints in case work in many parts of the world, some actual case studies using soil materials as evidence in court hearings have been published in international journals and books. This paper presents a case from the Campania region in Italy where soil analysis played a pivotal role. Employing a multiscale integrated approach encompassing soil microtomography, morphology, chemical analysis and geography, the study aimed to discern the origin of questioned soil residues found on a victim of crime. Results highlight the significance of considering spatial variability and an appropriate choice of analytical methods. The sequential and multiscale approach facilitated timely investigation without incurring unnecessary costs. Soil morphological and chemical analysis revealed inconsistencies between soil on the victim and soil at the suspected crime scenes, narrowing the investigative area down to approximately one square km. While detailed sampling did not yield statistically significant results, the evidence provided crucial insights, aiding investigators in working out what happened and helped in building a narrative around their case. The analysis indicated contact with a primary scene where the victim was likely dragged (over a Calcisol) and a final deposition site (over an Andosol) where the body was found. While potential murder sites were excluded, final guilt attribution remained inconclusive, and as in all trace evidence evaluation, it is not the role of the forensic soil scientist to consider the level of guilt, but to provide factual soil forensic evidence to assist the justice system. This study exemplifies the use of soil forensics in informing criminal investigations and highlights the complexities that can be involved in establishing comparability between soil samples.},

  abstract     = {This article introduces a new web-based and freely accessible tool, the Nitrate Fate tool (NFt), for the assessment of groundwater vulnerability to nitrate pollution in a variety of pedoclimatic conditions. The contamination of water resources by nitrate, in fact, represents a growing and persistent global environmental problem, and the utilization of practical tools to assist personnel working in the agricultural sector is key for mitigating the impact on land use, while maintaining farmers’ incomes. The (NFt) has been developed and integrated into the geospatial decision support system, LandSupport, as a way to support multiple stakeholders in conducting the so-called what-if scenario analysis (e.g., what would happen to the crop production if I substitute a quote of inorganic fertilizer with the same quote of an organic one?). The tool couples a state-of-art crop-growth model—which simulates crop growth dynamics, the nitrogen and carbon cycles—with a novel transfer function model in order to assess the transport of nitrate through the unsaturated zone to the groundwater table. Within the LandSupport platform, the results are shown both as coloured maps and as cumulative charts representing the travel times and the concentrations of root leachate to groundwater table depths. This work details the tool’s rationale, the coupling of the models, and their implementation. Moreover, this article shows examples of applications supporting several public authorities and end-users, underlining that, by combining all of the information on soils, groundwater table depths, management and climates, it is possible to obtain a comprehensive understanding of nitrogen transport dynamics. Two case studies are presented: the Piana del Sele and the eastern plain of Naples, both located in the Campania region of Italy. The results of the tool’s applications reveal significant groundwater vulnerability in both plains, mainly due to the shallow groundwater table depths, resulting in remarkably fast mean nitrate travel times ranging from 0 to 6 years. Finally, the tool provides a reproducible and replicable solution, and future implementation is foreseen for additional case studies all over the world.},

Besides the environmental goals to be reached by the single EU member state, these directives clearly underline the role of experts in supporting planners and public authorities to fulfil these objectives. This work presents a new web-based, freely-available dynamical tool, named the pesticide fate tool, developed within the geospatial Decision Support system (DSS), LandSupport, for the assessment of groundwater vulnerability, specific for type of pollutant. The tool is based on the extended transfer function model, specifically expanded to consider the transport of reactive solutes, such as pesticides. The work describes the tool implementation for three case studies, with different spatial scales and pedo-climatic conditions: Valle Telesina, IT, Marchfeld, AT, and Zala County, HU. Principal inputs of the tool are: soil physical and hydrological properties, climate, groundwater table depth, type of crops and related pesticides. Results of the model are shown through the LandSupport GUI both as coloured maps, representing the relative concentration of pesticide at the arrival to the water table at the end of the simulation period, and as cumulative charts of the solute arrival at the depth of interest. The three case studies are shown as examples of application of the LandSupport DSS in supporting the Water and Pesticides directives, demonstrating that it represents a valuable instrument for public authorities, environmental planners, as well as agricultural extension services. For example, large differences are shown by soils in filtering the tetraconazole (99.9% vs 76%), a fungicide used in viticulture, or different percentage of arrival (0.32% and 0,01%) to the groundwater table are shown for two herbicides (Tribenuron and Florasulam) largely used to control annual dicotyledonous weeds.},

  abstract     = {Nowadays, the business of ecotourism and rural tourism is a very important activity for many inland areas, enabling them to both produce important income and sustain the rural economy. Moreover, sustainable tourism is included in the UN 17th Sustainable Development Goal, which is to be achieved by 2030 (SDG 8.9 and SDG 12). Recent progress in digital tourism promises to deliver important changes to this activity, but most of this progress is addressed at well-known tourist destinations, so not dealing with the challenge of inland, rural and ecotourism. It is within this framework that this paper attempts to demonstrate that a new type of geoSpatial Decision Support System (S-DSS), developed on a Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) and with a substantial interdisciplinary core, could provide a valuable web-based operational tool which may be offered to both ecotourism and rural tourism end-users, planners and policy makers, so that they might better plan and manage this type of sustainable tourism. The S-DSS platform has also been designed to encourage use by the multi-user community (farmers, tourism enterprises, associations and public bodies). The methodology is linked to the creation of a GCI platform (www.landsupport.eu) that supports the acquisition, management, processing and analysis of both static (e.g. soil, geology) and dynamic data (e.g. environmental and daily climatic data), together with data visualization and computer on-the-fly applications, in order to perform modelling, all of which is potentially accessible via the Web. The S-DSS tool known as EcoSmarTour is demonstrated through a case study of the Campania region (South Italy) and, by connecting database and modelling, it aims to deliver a large amount of information that will improve knowledge of the territory, manage scenario analysis, produce maps and evaluate potential ecotourism footpaths or areas of interest, thus enabling the provision of better information on the entire ecotourism sector. The tool will also be demonstrated through reference to a short selection of additional use cases from elsewhere in Europe. Most importantly, the approach adopted is highly transferable because it relies on very general algorithms that can be easily applied wherever the necessary data are available.},

Five homogeneous zones (HZs) were identified by the PSS and characterized by soil profiles. CI measurements and field analysis showed clear features of physical (i.e., soil compaction, massive structure) degradation. XRF in situ (on profiles) analysis using portable equipment (pXRF) showed Pb, Cd and As concentrations exceeding the contamination thresholds provided by the Italian regulation for industrial land use up to 20 or 100 cm of depth. Hence, a validation procedure, based on pXRF field survey, was applied to the PSS approach used for the HZs identification. High consistency was found between the HZs and the PTEs in the most contaminated areas. Significant negative Pearson correlation coefficients were found between γ-rays dose rate and Pb, Cu, Zn, As and Ni; positive ones were found between γ-rays and autochthonous lithogenic elements (V, Ti, Mn, K, Sr, Nb, Zr, Rb, Th), confirming that higher radionuclide activity correlated with lower pollution levels.},

  abstract     = {Continual mapping and monitoring of impervious surfaces are crucial activities to support sustainable urban management strategies and to plan effective actions for environmental changes. In this context, impervious surface coverage is increasingly becoming an essential indicator for assessing urbanization and environmental quality, with several works relying on satellite imagery to determine it. However, although satellite imagery is typically available with a frequency of 3–10 days worldwide, imperviousness maps are released at most annually as they require a huge human effort to be produced and validated. Attempts have been made to extract imperviousness maps from satellite images using machine learning, but (i) the scarcity of reliable and detailed ground truth (ii) together with the need to manage different spectral bands (iii) while making the resulting system easily accessible to the end users is limiting their diffusion. To tackle these problems, in this work we introduce a deep-learning-based approach to extract imperviousness maps from multi-spectral Sentinel-2 images leveraging a very detailed imperviousness map realised by the Italian department for environment protection as ground truth. We also propose a scalable and portable inference pipeline designed to easily scale the approach, integrating it into a web-based Geographic Information System (GIS) application. As a result, even non-expert GIS users can quickly and easily calculate impervious surfaces for any place on Earth (accuracy >95%), with a frequency limited only by the availability of new satellite images.},

We applied ovitrap monitoring, geo-spatial analyses, mark-release-recapture technique, and a citizen-science approach. Results allow to predict the seasonal (from April to October, with peaks of 928–9,757 males/ha) and spatial distribution of the species, highlighting the capacity of Ae. albopictus population of Procida to colonize and maintain high frequencies in urban as well as in sylvatic inhabited environments. Irradiated males shown limited ability to disperse (mean daily distance travelled <60m) and daily survival estimates ranging between 0.80 and 0.95. Overall, the ecological characteristics of the island, the acquired knowledge on Ae. albopictus spatial and temporal distribution, the high human and Ae. albopictus densities and the positive attitude of the resident population in being active parts in innovative mosquito control projects provide the ground for evidence-based planning of the interventions and for the assessment of their effectiveness. In addition, the results highlight the value of creating synergies between research groups, local administrators, and citizens for affordable monitoring (and, in the future, control) of mosquito populations.},

Recent progress in modelling and Decision Support Systems (DSS) applied to agriculture promises to deliver important positive changes. However, most of this progress regards agriculture systems other than olive growing, so failing to challenge the environmental dimension of the olive grove and the landscape, which is a key issue in the planning and management of olive cultivation. This paper aims to demonstrate that a new type of DSS developed upon the open-source Geospatial Cyberinfrastructure (GCI) platform (named GeOlive) can provide a very important web-based operational tool for olive growing as it better connects productivity and environmental sustainability. This GCI platform supports the acquisition, management, and processing of both static and dynamic data (e.g. pedology, daily climate), data visualization, and computer on-the-fly applications in order to perform simulation modelling (e.g. evaluation of bioclimatic indices), all potentially accessible via the Web. The DSS tool, applied to an area of 20,000 ha in southern Italy, is designed to assist olive grove planning and management and provide operational support for farmers, farmer associations and decision makers involved in olive grove landscape. DSS outputs include olive grove planning and management scenario analysis and maps, together with evaluation of potential and current plant water stress. A short selection of practical case studies is presented to show the different use cases of the proposed DSS.},

In addition, we present three quantitative analysis of soil sealing at three different scales. The study at national level illustrated that the type of land use strongly affected soil-sealing dynamics. Indeed, the class complex cultivation pattern resulted the most fragile land use while forests resulted the most resilient one. The study at province level illustrated the key importance of having on-the-fly the map of rural fragmentation for any Italian province. This map—quantifying the landscape integrity of the rural and natural areas—enables to better locate both new green corridors or new urban developments minimizing the environmental impact of human activities. The study at municipality level demonstrated the importance of quantifying a pool of spatial planning indicators and illustrated that (a) the largest urban dispersion occurs in hilly touristic municipalities close to the sea, (b) the increase in soil sealing in rural sites is not related to population growth. As a result, Soil Monitor is deemed useful both to support decision making at different spatial scales and to raise awareness in people, professionals, and experts of other fields.

Recent progresses in modelling and Decision Support System (DSS) applied to the forestry sector promise to improve public participative forest management and decision-making in planning and conservation issues. However, most DSS are not open-source systems, being in many cases software designed for site-specific applications in forest ecosystems. Furthermore, some of these systems often miss challenging the integration of other land uses within the landscape matrix, which is a key issue in modern forestry planning aiming at linking recent developments in open-source Spatial-DSS systems to sectorial forest knowledge. This paper aims at demonstrating that a new type of S-DSS, developed within the Life+ project SOILCONSWEB over an open-source Geospatial Cyber-Infrastructure (GCI) platform, can provide a strategic web-based operational tool for forest resources management and multi-purpose planning. In order to perform simulation modelling, all accessible via the Web, the GCI platform supports acquisition and processing of both static and dynamic data (e.g., spatial distribution of soil and forest types, growing stock and yield), data visualization and computer on-the-fly applications. The DSS forestry tool has been applied to a forest area of 5,574 ha in the southern Apennines of Peninsular Italy, and it has been designed to address forest knowledge and management providing operational support to private forest owners and decision-makers involved in management of forest landscape at different levels. Such a geospatial S-DSS tool for supporting integrated forest knowledge at landscape represents a promising tool to implement sustainable forest management and planning. Results and output of the platform will be shown through a short selection of practical case studies.},

  abstract     = {Flow-like landslides are extremely hazardous phenomena that cause fatalities and damage to natural environments, such as loss of fertile soil cover and vegetation and damage to infrastructure. In the Campania region (southern Italy), previous studies have proved that the most catastrophic flow-like mass movements involve and evolve within a specific soil type: Andosols. Recent findings show that both Andosols and andic soils are widely diffused in the mountain ecosystems of Italy. In this framework, we aim to evaluate whether catastrophic flow-like landslides, historically recorded in Italy, took place where these soils are settled. Soils collected in 12 flow-like landslides that occurred in Italy in the last 70 years were investigated. Chemical, physical and hydrological properties of soil samples collected from the detachment areas under different environmental and geological settings were analysed. Soils showed evidences of the andosolization process that enabled their identification as andic soils. Topsoils were well developed, demonstrating low soil erosion in spite of the high-to-moderate slope steepness and the anthropic stress due to land management. High water-retention capacity, marked chemical and physical fertility, high organic carbon content and prevalent loamy texture are common properties of all the studied soils. Therefore, despite the lithological heterogeneity of the bedrock and other environmental factors, the 12 soils revealed considerably homogeneous properties. Our study suggests a direct relationship between flow-like mass movements and andic soils in the studied environments. These findings shed new light on the pedological similarity of the materials involved in flow-like landslides in Italy.},

  abstract     = {Large variability in the spatial distribution and content of metals is generally recognised in anthropogenically-polluted soils, hence, a detailed site investigation implying the collection and analysis of a large number of soil samples is often necessary. To this regard, the selection of a rapid, cost-effective and accurate analytical technique to assess the concentration of metals in soil is of paramount importance. The overall objective of this work was to evaluate the possibility of assessing the aqua regia-extractable (AR) content of metals in soil from the multi-element profile of the soil obtained by a portable X-ray fluorescence analyser (pXRF). To this objective, we attempted: (i) to establish, by simple linear regressions, the relations occurring between the metal contents measured by pXRF and AR in laboratory setting on air-dried and 2 mm-sieved soil samples from two case studies (A-agricultural and B-industrial sites); (ii) to define metal-based linear models predicting metal AR contents from pXRF measurements; (iii) to assess the influence of metal properties and sources on relations found between the two analytical methods. Very satisfying correlations (R2 > 0.90) were observed between the AR and pXRF contents of Ca, Cu, Cr, Ni, Pb and Zn in the site A, and of Cd, Cu, Pb and Zn in the site B. For the majority of metals, lower AR than pXRF contents were measured, as result of the AR incomplete dissolution of metal-bearing silicates. This was not observed when metals - of anthropogenic origin - occurred in soil in very high concentrations (i.e., Cr for A and Pb for B). In both sites, the comparison among different regression parameters revealed a strong metal-dependence. Moreover, for most of the metals, the parameters of each metal-regression line significantly differed between the two case studies, indicating site-dependence of regression fits.},

At present, advances in proximal sensing and spatial data analysis are available to characterize soil systems and detect changes in physical or chemical properties useful to understand and manage the variation within fields in a site-specific way. The objective of this work was to verify the suitability of geostatistical techniques to fuse data measured with different geophysical sensors for delineating homogeneous within-field zones for Precision Agriculture. A geophysical survey, using electromagnetic induction (EMI) and ground penetrating radar (GPR), was carried out at Montecorvino Rovella in the southern Apennines (Salerno, Italy). Both sensors (EMI and GPR) enabled the assessment of variation of soil dielectric properties both laterally and vertically. The study area is a 5 ha terraced olive grove under organic cropping. The sensor surveys were carried out along the terraces and over the entire field. The multi-sensor data were analyzed using geostatistical techniques to estimate synthetic scale-dependent regionalized factors. The results allowed the division of the study area into smaller areas, characterized by different properties that could impact agronomic management. In particular, a large area was delineated in the northern part of the grove, where apparent soil electrical conductivity and radar attenuation were greater. Through soil profiling it was shown that soils of the northern macro-area refer to deep, well developed, clayey Luvic Phaezem, whereas soils of the southern macro-area are shallower and less developed, sandy loam Leptic Calcisol. The proposed geostatistical approach effectively combined the complementary 2D EMI and 3D GPR measurements, to delineate areas characterized by different soil horizontal and vertical conditions. This within-olive grove partition might be advantageously used for site-specific tillage and fertilization.},

  abstract     = {Climate change (CC) directly influences agricultural sectors, presenting the need to identify both adaptation and mitigation actions that can make local farming communities and crop production more resilient. In this context, the viticultural sector is one of those most challenged by CC due to the need to combine grape quality, grapevine cultivar adaptation and therefore farmers' future incomes. Thus, understanding how suitability for viticulture is changing under CC is of primary interest in the development of adaptation strategies in traditional wine-growing regions. Considering that climate is an essential part of the terroir system, the expected variability in climate change could have a marked influence on terroir resilience with important effects on local farming communities in viticultural regions.
From this perspective, the aim of this paper is to define a new dynamic viticultural zoning procedure that is able to integrate the effects of CC on grape quality responses and evaluate terroir resilience, providing a support tool for stakeholders involved in viticultural planning (winegrowers, winegrower consortiums, policy makers etc.). To achieve these aims, a Hybrid Land Evaluation System, combining qualitative (standard Land Evaluation) and quantitative (simulation model) approaches, was applied within a traditional region devoted to high quality wine production in Southern Italy (Valle Telesina, BN), for a specific grapevine cultivar (Aglianico). The work employed high resolution climate projections that were derived under two different IPCC scenarios, namely RCP 4.5 and RCP 8.5. The results obtained indicate that: (i) only 2% of the suitable area of Valle Telesina expresses the concept of terroir resilience orientated towards Aglianico ultra quality grape production; (ii) within 2010–2040, it is expected that 41% of the area suitable for Aglianico cultivation will need irrigation to achieve quality grape production; (iii) by 2100, climate change benefits for the cultivation of Aglianico will decrease, as well as the suitable areas.},

On analysing the maps, a good correspondence was found among the outputs obtained from measurements at depths between 0 and 2 m, with a spatial resolution that is slightly better for ARP. The procedure of Normalized Sum of Relative Differences on Geophysical Covariates (NSRDGC) was applied to the 15 maps in order to obtain an integrated variability map of all the surveyed anomalies using the proximal sensors. The resulting map identified the most homogeneous areas where five soil profiles and eight trenches were dug. Field morphological observations enabled three different types of anthropogenic materials enriched in Cr and Zn to be identified. According to their morphology in depth, these materials were not emplaced in a single event. Earth movement and landfilling were carried out at several times in the same area, where a mix of contaminated materials and natural soil is found in the first metre, whereas organic materials are visible separately, probably as a consequence of separate excavations and landfill. Soil micromorphology observations evidenced the presence of Cr-enriched organic materials and secondary crystalline gypsum minerals as well as organic matter coatings inside pores. Such observations suggest the possible fate of some contaminants, highlighting soil mineral and organic associations, as well as the presence of pedofeatures indicating downward movement of colloidal materials.},

  abstract     = {Andic soils have unique morphological, physical, and chemical properties that induce both considerable soil fertility and great vulnerability to land degradation. Moreover, they are the most striking mineral soils in terms of large organic C storage and long C residence time. This is especially related to the presence of poorly crystalline clay minerals and metal–humus complexes. Recognition of andic soils is then very important. Here we attempt to show, through a combined analysis of 35 sampling points chosen in accordance to specific physical and vegetation rules, that some andic soils have an utmost ecological importance. More specifically, in Italian non-volcanic mountain ecosystems ( > 600 m a.s.l.) combining low slope (< 21 %) and highly active green biomass (high NDVI values) and in agreement to recent findings, we found the widespread occurrence of andic soils having distinctive physical and hydrological properties including low bulk density and remarkably high water retention. Most importantly, we report a demonstration of the ability of these soils to affect ecosystem functions by analysing their influence on the timescale acceleration of photosynthesis estimated by NDVI measurements. Our results are hoped to be a starting point for better understanding of the ecological importance of andic soils and also possibly to better consider pedological information in C balance calculations.},

They provide large amounts and different types of data which need to be combined. An integrated approach, using multivariate geostatistical data-fusion techniques and multi-source geophysical sensor data to determine simple summary scale-dependent indices, is described here. These indices can be used to delineate management zones to be submitted to differential management. Such a data fusion approach with geophysical sensors was applied in a soil of an agronomic field cropped with tomato. The synthetic regionalized factors determined, contributed to split the 3D edaphic environment into two main horizontal structures with different hydraulic properties and to disclose two main horizons in the 0–1.0-m depth with a discontinuity probably occurring between 0.40 m and 0.70 m. Comparing this partition with the soil properties measured with a shallow sampling, it was possible to verify the coherence in the topsoil between the dielectric properties and other properties more directly related to agronomic management. These results confirm the advantages of using proximal sensing as a preliminary step in the application of site-specific management. Combining disparate spatial data (data fusion) is not at all a naive problem and novel and powerful methods need to be developed.},

  abstract     = {Over recent decades, andic soils have been increasingly found in non-volcanic mountain ecosystems (NVME) in many parts of the world. In Italy, this type of soil has proved to be greatly affected by aeolian deposits and to be widely distributed geographically. However, there are still many open questions, especially regarding the genesis of these soils. This paper focuses on five representative pedons taken from NVME. Soil forming processes and relationships between soil and underlying bedrock were investigated by using an integrated approach including geochemical, magnetic, mineralogical, micromorphological and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis. The 5 pedons showed andic character and similar morphology and micromorphology (e.g. silt illuviation, pedorelicts), as well as large differences in terms of soil reaction and clay mineralogy. The analysis of the vertical distribution of C, Al and Fe extracted in pyrophosphate along with related geochemical indices (e.g. Cp/Alp) enabled us to indicate andosolization as the main process of soil formation and to exclude podzolization. With respect to the soil-bedrock relationship, 2 soils showed great similarity to the underlying bedrock along with a clear aeolian particle size distribution footprint, whereas, in the remaining 3 soils, there was a clear soil-bedrock discontinuity and an evident volcanic fingerprint. Some of the soil-bedrock differences related to the geographical settings and latitude.},

In 2011, leaf-off dedicated airborne LiDAR data were collected in a 20,000 ha inland patchy area which was representative of soil land use in the Apennines mountains of southern Italy. By combining field and LiDAR data in 5574 ha of forests with coexisting evergreen and deciduous species, we modelled common forest stand variables (height, diameter, volume and biomass) with high accuracy (0.60 ≤ Adj.R² ≤ 0.89). Moreover, a moderate correlation (0.425 ≤ τ ≤ 0.462) between field- and LiDAR-derived diversity indices was found. About 3393 ha of forests are enclosed in protected areas of the Natura 2000 network, which in turn possesses 77\% (~576,286 Mg) of total aboveground dry biomass. Overall, eight forest types were identified, one of which, the European beech, is only found in the Natura 2000 sites, while other forest types are also found elsewhere. This is the first study to undertake a LiDAR analysis of Mediterranean forests in the Campania Region and might help better evaluate trade-offs, especially in protected areas, in order to enhance multiple benefits and support sustainable management of forests.},

It has been proved that providing operational answers to these demands and problems is extremely difficult. Here we aim to demonstrate that a spatial decision support system based on geospatial cyberinfrastructure (GCI) can address all of the above, so producing a smart system for supporting decision making for agriculture, forestry, and urban planning with respect to the landscape. In this paper, we discuss methods and results of a special kind of GCI architecture, one that is highly focused on land management and soil conservation. The system allows us to obtain dynamic, multidisciplinary, multiscale, and multifunctional answers to agriculture, forestry, and urban planning issues through the Web. The system has been applied to and tested in an area of about 20 000 ha in the south of Italy, within the framework of a European LIFE+ project (SOILCONSWEB). The paper reports – as a case study – results from two different applications dealing with agriculture (olive growth tool) and environmental protection (soil capability to protect groundwater). Developed with the help of end users, the system is starting to be adopted by local communities. The system indirectly explores a change of paradigm for soil and landscape scientists. Indeed, the potential benefit is shown of overcoming current disciplinary fragmentation over landscape issues by offering – through a smart Web-based system – truly integrated geospatial knowledge that may be directly and freely used by any end user (www.landconsultingweb.eu). This may help bridge the last very important divide between scientists working on the landscape and end users.},

  abstract     = {Soils with andic features are known to be very important as regards both ecosystem fertility and susceptibility to land degradation. In recent years there has been an increasing number of finds of these soils in non-volcanic mountain ecosystems (NVME) in different parts of the world under different environmental settings. In Italian NVME there has been extensive investigation proving that these soils have a much wider distribution than previously thought. But despite these important findings, very little is known about their genesis or properties. Against this background, our investigation aims to question the nature of parent material in andic soils in Italian NVME; we consider this question fundamental for proper understanding of such soils. We address the question of the parent material by highlighting similarities/dissimilarities between soils and their underlying bedrocks and ascertaining whether soils developed as a result of in situ weathering or because of eolian inputs. The study was conducted on 41 soil profiles distributed throughout Italian NVME, performing an integrated analysis of (i) grain-size distribution (GSD) by laser granulometry, (ii) end-member modelling of obtained GSD, (iii) soil–bedrock differences in magnetic susceptibility, and (iv) soil–bedrock differences based on the geochemistry of 38 elements. The final results from these investigations show that the investigated soils are mainly derived from eolian sediments and that weathering of the underlying bedrock plays a minor role. Two main types of eolian parent materials seem to coexist in different proportions according to the soil type: eolian sediments with a similar composition of the underlying bedrock (termed autochthonous loess) and eolian sediments of volcanic type (pyroclasts). Autochthonous loess represents the main component of the parent material in the following studied soils: Aluandic Andosols, Cambisols, Phaeozems and Podzol (67%, 63%, 44% and 73%, respectively). All these soils exhibit low to moderate andic features. Volcanic-type eolian sediments constitute about 90% of the parent material in most andic soils that are Silandic Andosols, but occur in different proportions in most of the investigated soils. The nature of soil parent materials surprisingly follows a clear trend with latitude, with autochthonous loess characterizing most parent materials in northern Italy whilst volcanic sediments form most parent materials in the south.

  abstract     = { This paper addresses the following points: how can whole soil data from normally available soil mapping databases (both conventional and those integrated by digital soil mapping procedures) be usefully employed in hydrology? Answering this question requires a detailed knowledge of the quality and quantity of information embedded in and behind a soil map. To this end a description of the process of drafting soil maps was prepared (which is included in Appendix A of this paper). Then a detailed screening of content and availability of soil maps and database was performed, with the objective of an analytical evaluation of the potential and the limitations of soil data obtained through soil surveys and soil mapping. Then we reclassified the soil features according to their direct, indirect or low hydrologic relevance. During this phase, we also included information regarding whether this data was obtained by qualitative, semi-quantitative or quantitative methods. The analysis was performed according to two main points of concern: (i) the hydrological interpretation of the soil data and (ii) the quality of the estimate or measurement of the soil feature. The interaction between pedology and hydrology processes representation was developed through the following Italian case studies with different hydropedological inputs: (i) comparative land evaluation models, by means of an exhaustive itinerary from simple to complex modelling applications depending on soil data availability, (ii) mapping of soil hydrological behaviour for irrigation management at the district scale, where the main hydropedological input was the application of calibrated pedo-transfer functions and the Hydrological Function Unit concept, and (iii) flood event simulation in an ungauged basin, with the functional aggregation of different soil units for a simplified soil pattern. In conclusion, we show that special care is required in handling data from soil databases if full potential is to be achieved. Further, all the case studies agree on the appropriate degree of complexity of the soil hydrological model to be applied. We also emphasise that effective interaction between pedology and hydrology to address landscape hydrology requires (i) greater awareness of the hydrological community about the type of soil information behind a soil map or a soil database, (ii) the development of a better quantitative framework by the pedological community for evaluating hydrological features, and (iii) quantitative information on soil spatial variability.},

  abstract     = {Soil-vegetation-atmosphere transfer (SVAT) models require high-resolution precipitation data which often are not available at the landscape scale where spatial-sparse data are the usual setting. In such framework we compared various neural-based inference systems to recognize the most performing structures for gaining reliable rainfall predictions at high spatiotemporal resolution (20 × 20 m by 10 days). More technologies are combined with neurocomputing having as objective model comparison in case of limited data. The feasibility of modeling very small datasets by means of the bootstrap aggregating technique is explored. Furthermore two aggregation methods (i.e. average or principal component regression) and two methods for selecting the best artificial neural network components (based on genetic algorithms or on percentiles of mean square error) are investigated. The core architecture is a three-layer, feed-forward, fully interconnected artificial neural network (ANN) with topology 11:11:1 and Levenberg–Marquardt training algorithm. Three inference systems are developed using this type of ANN as a building block: (a) a single network (SN), (b) a large, bootstrapped ensemble of ANNs (BAGNET), and (c) a smaller ensemble of ANNs (sBN) selected for their strong performance. According to the structure of simulation signals, these frameworks make inferences in temporal domain (e.g. a 1 year series at an unknown location), in spatial domain (e.g. a 10-days map of spatial distribution of rainfall), or in between (e.g. a 1 year stack of rainfall maps). A method to improve the spatial maps is accomplished. It uses a geostatistical filter based on an indicator variable describing the distribution of non-rainy observations in space. A validation procedure is performed to pursue the best technology mix for addressing inferences in any case study setting. Results show that in case of very few data (Cilento region) mixed technologies (e.g. boostrap, principal component regression, and genetic algorithms) are required to keep the validation error comparable to that of the single networks calibrated on more data (Campania region).},
